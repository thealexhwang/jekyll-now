title: Reverse Dieting - Does it really work?
---

I started a diet plan called reverse dieting about a month ago.  Reverse dieting is exactly how it sounds, to the bone.  You take your daily macro nutrients (carbs, fats, fiber, and caloric intake) and you flip around what you would do when most people go on a diet.  You ADD!  This type of plan isn't for those who want to lose weight right here and right now, instead it's for those who are looking for the long run.  Those who really want to invest in the time to increase their resting and active metabolic rates to look even sharper for their next cut.

The process behind the plan is to increase your food intake by 80-100 calories, which should come from roughly 20g of carbs every 1-2 weeks, while keeping your fats to 20-30% of your diet.  During these intervals your body will produce a hormone called leptin.  Leptin is what controls your appetite, metabolism, and behavior, and the body produces enough to maintain homeostasis.  In other words, the body will burn more calories and raise the caloric level that you can maintain your weight.

Now, does it work?  So far it has been working well for me.  I increased my daily intake to roughly 2300 calories while keeping the same weight, but it's still early.  I'll keep at it for a few more months and hit up another post on its results.
