title: Food Sites to Check Out
---

There are quite A LOT of food sites out on the internet now.  Some better the others in terms of how often it's updated, quality of pictures, and availability of recipes.  If you find yourself overwhelmed by what is available, here are a few sites I enjoy checking out on a weekly or even daily basis:

Food Porn Daily - _www.foodporndaily.com_
This site is least enjoyable on an empty stomach.  The amount of preparation, lighting, and Photoshop that goes into each picture makes this site the top contender for mouthwatering food pics.  They do update the site at least once per day with new pictures and recipes; however a major issue is apparent when you instinctively click on the picture to get its recipe.  Instead of bringing you to the its darkest secrets, clicking moves forward to the next picture, which is unnecessarily frustrating until you can remember that this site purposely wants you angry.
(Recipe is located below the picture by clicking on the dish name and recipe owner)

Food Gawker - _www.foodgawker.com_
Largest database of recipes period.  There's nothing you can't find here, and it is updated with at least 20 new user-submitted recipes each day.  The great thing about Food Gawker is they have a "view "and "like" rating.  Essentially, it calculates how many times each recipe has been clicked on and how many times it is "hearted" or liked (think of Yelp! for foodies).  If I'm feeling adventurous, I always check here for new recipes to try!

For the Love of Cooking - _www.fortheloveofcooking.net_
This is one of my favorite food blogs out there.  The amount of quality information each post provides is amazing, not to mention all the pictures!  All the recipes posted are your typical home cooking style, so you won't find those nit-picky recipes that call for ingredients that you may have never heard of (I know you know what I'm taking about).  The only drawback to this site is they do not update as often as I'd like, however I still feel it is the best home cooking blog on the internet.
(Cheers for home-style cooking and not having to make dishes look like small architectural masterpieces)

I know there are many great sites/blogs out there, but these are my personal favorites.  I may make it a personal goal to visit every site at least once, but it would be nearly impossible to do so.  For every site I visit, there would be a new one that is introduced.  I would be chasing my own tail.  We'll see.
